A primary purpose of this lab is to encourage and enable Infrastructure
as Code (IaC) principles. It is designed to be interacted with via IaC methods.

*Martin Fowler defines IaC:*

>Infrastructure as code is the approach to defining computing and network
>infrastructure through source code that can then be treated just like any 
>software system.

As you might have heard Infrastructure as Code could be more aptly called,
Infrastructure as Config-Files. Whether using config management tools such as
Ansible/Puppet/Chef or containers we provide the supporting services to make it
easy to get the job done.
